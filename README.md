# COMP-250-Assignment-2

This exercise was part of my knowledge of testing concepts of inheritance and polymorphism

I had to model a food service industry. This included places where customers can buy food: restaurants, food stands, and fast food.
I had to illustrate model that allowe  payment of bills, including sales tax and tip. I also model a tax collector who collects both sales tax and income tax. 
This led to the decription of workers' income and tax for a year.
